    <Comments>Study Data: Although it is the goal of the Commonwealth Statistician to produce Life Tables on a decennial basis, the possible effect on the civilian population of conditions arising from the 1939-45 War rendered it undesirable to take into account deaths occurring prior to 1946.  Accordingly, the Life Tables have been based on the population recorded at the 1947 Census in conjunction with the deaths during 1946, 1947 and 1948. The greater part of the data which have been used is from the official Report on the Census and the bulletins of Demography published annually. The principal statistics employed are (a) the census population, male and female separately, at individual ages; (b) the deaths during 1946 to 1948, male and female separately; (c) births between 1940 and 1948; and (d) the deaths from 1941 to 1948, at ages under six years, subdivided in the case of deaths under one year of age during the last three years of the period, into deaths in each quarter of age. Furthermore, the proximity to the 1939-45 War, the inauguration of large scale migration shortly after the end of the War and the marked increase in the number of births in recent years, necessitated a careful examination, both in the aggregate and at individual ages, of the population movements which had taken place. Examination revealed that, for males, the addition to the census population to allow for migration operated in the opposite direction to, and was sufficient to minimize, the deduction to allow for the movement in Defense personnel. In the case of women, the effect of migration was not significant. Methodology: An examination of the data showed that the omissions of age at death had been largely confined to the population above school age and for the purpose of constructing the Life Tables, the numbers of unknown age were distributed proportionately among the population aged 15 and over. For the calculation of the rates of mortality applicable to the main span of ages, the method of the late George King, F.I.A., which has been adopted in England for all National Life Tables since 1911 and which was used for the construction of the Australian 1932-34 Tables (See SOA Table Identities 60011 and 60026), was implemented. King's osculatory interpolation process was applied to the function log (q(x) + 0.1) to obtain a smoothly graduated series of mortality rates for ages 16 to 81. For infantile ages, a special method involving computation of mortality rates directly from the records of births and deaths has been used. For ages 6 to 15, a fourth difference formula based on the mortality rates for ages 4, 5, 11, 16 and 17 was used to obtain intervening values. Previous Australian National Tables have arbitrarily assumed a mortality rate of unity at age 104 and, in 1933, proceeded to insert the intermediate values from age 88 by interpolatory processes. Such an assumption for the present Tables would have produced unjustifiably high mortality rates at the advanced ages. As the data was sparse at advanced ages, the mortality rates from age 87 onwards were therefore completed by means of a Gompertz formula. In order to obtain a satisfactory junction between the mortality rates up to age 81 and those from age 86 onwards, the rates between these ages were derived by osculatory interpolation.
